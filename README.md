EvenyWhereSlideLibrary
This library is not a standart library. I want to make a Library,but i am lazy. Sorry.
EveryBody, you can alter this library. now,i say its function:

1.It is extends RelativeLayout,it only has two child view or child ViewGroup.

2.if you want  to make a bottom View   ,you must  make this view to first location.

3.you must do some configuration ,such as :
    <com.flyme.evenywhereslidelibrary.SlideLayout 
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="90dip"
        android:gravity="left"
        >
        </com.flyme.evenywhereslidelibrary.SlideLayout >
  you must use "gravity" ,beacuse it can discern you want to left slide  or right slide or top slide  or  bottom slide.
